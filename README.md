Practical Machine Learning Project
The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. 
If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been 
very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

Human Activity Recognition

What you should submit
The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. 
This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables 
to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you 
used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made 
the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

Reproducibility
Due to security concerns with the exchange of R code, your code will not be run during the 
evaluation by your classmates. Please be sure that if they download the repo, they will be 
able to view the compiled HTML version of your analysis.
